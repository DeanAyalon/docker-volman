# Purpose
This repository was made to generate a dynamic container with all the existing named volumes as mounts - To allow for easy data management.

# Future
I may in the future customize this some more to allow:
- Volume selection 
- Permission management
- Some sort of GUI
- Other volume tweaks and scripts
- Dynamic volume assignment ([docker-gen](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/docker-gen)?)

But currently, this suits me just fine, all I need is to access the files within all my volumes
